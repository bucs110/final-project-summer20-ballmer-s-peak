## Project Description
<< Give an overview of your project >>

***    

## User Interface Design
* << A wireframe or drawing of the user interface concept along with a short description of the interface. You should have one for each screen in your program. >>
    * For example, if your program has a start screen, game screen, and game over screen, you should include a wireframe / screenshot / drawing of each one and a short description of the components
* << You should also have a screenshot of each screen for your final GUI >>

***        

## Program Design
* Non-Standard libraries
    * << You should have a list of any additional libraries or modules used (pygame, request) beyond non-standard python. >>
    * For each additional module you should include
        * url for the module documentation
        * a short description of the module
* Class Interface Design
    * << A simple drawing that shows the class relationships in your code (see below for an example). >>
        * ![class diagram](assets/class_diagram.jpg)
    * This does not need to be overly detailed, but should show how your code fits into the Model/View/Controller paradigm.
* Classes
    * << You should have a list of each of your classes with a description. >>
